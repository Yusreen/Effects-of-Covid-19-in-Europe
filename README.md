# Effects-of-Covid-19-in-Europe (An Azure Data Engineering project on UDEMY)
This project looks at datasets to study the overall effect of Covid-19 in Europe in 2020.

## Goal of the project
Thee goal is to visualize the death count, admission count as well as the vaccination count per country in Europe. The project also attemps to find the link between confirmed cases
and Covid-19 vaccines.

## Dataset
Data is ingested from 2 sources:
1. ECDC website to extract: Confirmed cases, Mortality, Hospitalization/ICU cases, Testing numbers
2. Eurostat website to extract Population by age

We started out with the intention of reading the data from the website itself. However, due to the new permission barrier, the course instructor created a gitbub repo for the 
datasets: https://github.com/cloudboxacademy/covid19.
